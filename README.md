# CS:GO Grenade Usage Analysis

![CSGO Banner](csgo.png)

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of grenade usage in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, focusing on the relationship between grenade damage and match outcomes/players rank across different maps.

## Key Findings

1. **Grenade Damage and Match Victory**
   - Statistical analysis with 90% confidence level shows that teams dealing more grenade damage tend to win matches.
   - The correlation varies significantly across different maps.
   - This relationship is not focused on causality analysis (Higher Damage > Wins or Wins > Higher Damage).

2. **Map-Specific Analysis**
   - Maps like de_overpass and de_cache show stronger correlation (~66.67%) between grenade damage and victory
   - Analysis includes heat maps of grenade landing positions for strategic insights
